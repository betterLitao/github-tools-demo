## New Features
- Added mathematical functions to `src/index.js`:
  - `factorial` function for calculating factorials
  - `isPalindrome` function for checking palindromes
  - `fibonacci` function for generating Fibonacci sequences
- Added utility functions to `src/utils.js`:
  - `generateId` for creating random IDs
  - `deepClone` for deep cloning objects
  - `debounce` for debouncing function execution
- Created `src/demo.js` to showcase all new functions
- Updated README with documentation for new features

These changes enhance the demo project with practical utility functions and mathematical operations that can be used for testing GitHub integrations.
